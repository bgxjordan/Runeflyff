---- 0.80.0 ------
- Migrate project to the Qt5 framework
- Move MySQL dependencies out of the project files
- Require C++11 support to compile the project. As part of this, drop support for old compilers
- Drop Windows XP / Vista support - you can probably still compile it, but exposing those platforms to the internet will get your machine wrecked.

---- 0.74.2.2 ----
This version will build under MinGW 4.8.1 as well as Visual Studio. I was able to build it
successfully using --std=c++11 as well.

---- 0.74.2.1 ----
This is the Cmake version of 0.74.2. I made some slight adjustments to pmutex to get it to
build under Visual Studio 2010. This will (hopefully) work under 2012 and 2013 as well.

---- 0.74.2 ----
This is the latest version I could find online of the Runeflyff source. Very minor changes
from the 0.74 version.

---- 0.74 -----
This was the last official version floating around. There is also an unofficial Runeflyff+
based on this branch, and a 0.74.2 branch. The latter will be added after this.
